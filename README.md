# Position Punch
PositionPunch is a 3D boxing game where reading your opponent is the only way to win.

# How to play
You have four actions you can do as you exchange blows with your opponent:
**Jab,** **Feint,** **Guard,** and **Slip**.\
Exchanges are won by performing an action that results in a hit against your opponent, i.e. slipping when your opponent jabs. The full list of interactions can be found below.
